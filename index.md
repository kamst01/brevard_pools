### We treat every customer the same. No matter the situation or condition of their pool; we will take care of you.

Owning a pool is a privilege & owning a pool should come with pride. When we come to clean / care / maintain your pool, we understand that it is a special commodity. 

We understand that our business is service. We make sure to bring the best pool service & customer service to every appointment! No matter the size of the job - maintenance, cleaning, power washing, green pools, chlorine or salt - we come prepared.

#### How we're different

We've been working with Brevard Country, Florida **since 2012**! Since day one, we've trained our employees to not only pay attention to details, but to put themselves in the customers shoes. Every time we finish an appointment, we hear great real-time feedback from our customers : how we're always professional, timely & orderly when we arrive.

What do we bring besides great pool servicing & fantastic customer service? **FREE Chemicals!** Every appointment we provide our own chemicals that we will use during our work at your residence / location. We also water test your pool at every visit!

#### If you see us around the Island, don't hesitate to honk! We love seeing friendly faces!

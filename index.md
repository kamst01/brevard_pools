        have         the         newest         in pool vacuum technology as

        vacuum         head. We use the same         technique to
        vacuum         every inch of the bottom of the pool, every single visit.
        A fun fact we call this technique "mowing the lawn" because you wouldn't
        miss a blade of grass mowing the lawn; well we won't miss anything in
        your pool either!

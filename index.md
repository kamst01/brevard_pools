One of our friendly service technicians would love to put a smile on your face! After when you see your pool and all you can say is "WOW". 

**Call today (407)-WOW-POOL**

At Brevard Pool Care we have made a name for ourselves for premium pool service. We are not satisfied until YOU ARE satisfied - maintenance, cleaning, power washing, green pools, chlorine or salt - we come prepared and do not leave until all expectations are met.

#### How we're different

We've been working with Brevard County, Florida **since 2012**! At Brevard Pool Care we have been a premium pool concierge service since day one. We offer an all inclusive premium servicing focusing on every aspect of your pool. We break our weekly service plans with all three aspects of the pool in mind. 

* Pool Service Cleaning
* Water Chemistry & balance
* Equipment Maintenance

All pools are different, but yet all pools require the same weekly maintenance procedure. At Brevard Pool Care we have perfected a **10 step process** to cover the three aspects listed above. What is the **10 step process** you ask?

**10 STEP PROCESS:**

**This process is required to be performed on every regular weekly service visit in this order by our service technicians: of course modified to your pool's specific needs.**

 1. **Brush Tile / Grout lines**-
    * Every inch of tile will be brushed and grout lines will be clean and free of algae. Tile scum will be removed. Removal of any calcium-deposits* where applicable. 
 2. **Empty skimmer and Pump basket**-
    * Every visit we leave your baskets free of debris. Emptying of baskets allows maximum water flow. Inspection of O-ring at the pump lid upon opening, lube if necessary. 
 3. **Net debris off surface of water**-
    * We use the highest quality nets to capture the smallest debris and pollen and our technicians are netting experts! We use a technique to net every inch of surface area of the water.
 4. **Vacuum every single visit**-
    * Pool will be vacuumed every single visit. We have the newest in pool vacuum technology as well as the old faithful system hose and vacuum head. We use the same technique to vacuum every inch of the bottom of the pool, every single visit. A fun fact we call this technique "mowing the lawn" because you wouldn't miss a blade of grass mowing the lawn; well we won't miss anything in your pool either!
 5. **Net remaining debris until spotless**-
    * By spotless we mean it! Debris as well as nails or metal toys can leave unwanted stains. We can remove the metal or debris and work on removing any stains*.
 6. **Brush entire surface of pool**- 
    * Brushing the walls, floor, steps, stairs, etc; every visit! All while focusing on spots/stains that require more attention.
 7. **Check/Balance chemicals**- 
    * We balance the pool accordingly to the weather conditions. Checking and maintaining the following chemicals: Chlorine, Salt, P.H., Alkalinity, Stabilizer-CYA, Calcium Hardness. Phosphates* and nitrates will be tested and removed as necessary.
 8. **Filter Cleaning**-  
    * Filter will be cleaned regularly as required by the manufacture. Most require monthly cleaning. The equipment will be checked for leaks and in proper running condition before leaving your property. Salt Cells will be scheduled to be cleaned every 3 months*.
 9. **Equipment Inspection**-
    * The equipment will be inspected for air leaks on the suction side and water leaks on equipment. Equipment will be replaced as needed to maintain premium operation.
10. **Log chemicals and chemical dosages** 
    * We use a premium route management software to log all our customers chemicals readings and dosages we added to your pool every visit! By keeping track we can see the issues that may arise well in the future and take the proper preventative maintenance.

\*additional cost in some instances.

What do we bring besides great premium pool servicing & fantastic customer service?  Every appointment our pool trucks are well equipped mobile pool store on wheels to your residence / location. 

#### If you see one of our trucks, don't hesitate to honk! We love seeing friendly faces!

**Our expectations**

Our only expectation is that the equipment is up to date on repairs and is running properly. if we suspect a leak we take proper actions to have it repaired.
